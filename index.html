Practical No : 1

Aim: Write a python program to create a class Student with data members (name, roll number, 

marks). Accept details for at least 5 students and display them.

Introduction: This python program demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts by 

creating a students class to manage and display student details.

Objective: The objective of this program is to implement a Student class with data members for 

name, roll number and marks, accept details for five students and display them.

Theory: In python, classes are used to represent real-world entities through object-oriented 

programming (OOP). The student class in this program contains three data members: name, roll 

number, and marks, which store individual student details. The __init__ constructor initializes these 

attributes when a new object is created. The display() method prints Student details in a formatted 

way, representing how methods define behavior in OOP.

The program uses a list to store multiple Student objects, making data management easier. A loop

is used to accept details of five Students from user input. Each set of input is passed to the 

constructor, creating a new Student object which is appended to the list. Finally, another loop 

iterates through the list and calls the display() method to show all Student information.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of binding data and method into a single unit, i.e. a 

class: it protects data by controlling access through defined method.

Object: An object is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity. It contains data 

(attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by the class.

Constructor: A Constructor is a special method (__init__ in python) that automatically initializes 

object attributes when an object is created. It assigns values to data members at the time of object 

creation.

Method: A method is a function defined inside a class that operates on its objects.

Conclusion: The program successfully demonstrated object-oriented programming by using a class 

to manage Student data, highlighting encapsulation, storing and displaying multiple student 

records.
